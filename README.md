Hi! I'm Michel, and i'm probably the only DJ, violinist and computer engineer you know. This summer I dived into the world of Machine Learning with the goal of building software that could actually DJ. So, I took an online course offered by Stanford university and it allowed me to work on different projects: from linear regression problems predicting housing prices and the development of real estate in a specific region, to training logistic regression neural networks for handwriting recognition. This semester at Georgia Tech I am conducting research in AI applications for finance. In my team, we are working on developing a revolutionary reiforcement learning Q-agent which will decide to reallocate stock weights in a financial portfolio to maximize returns.
