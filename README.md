Content-based movie recommender I use on "movie Saturdays" with friends.

Built content-based recommender system for movies using Python.

Created "data soup" vector for each movie, containing movie description keywords, genre, title, crew, and cast.

Applied the CountVectorizer( ) to each movie vector and computed the cosine similarity between each pair of vectors.

Output 10 most similar movies (highest cosine similarity score) to input movie.
