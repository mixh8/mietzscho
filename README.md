Vulcan is one of the 4 drones proposed by my team, Angel, at the Georgia Tech x Emory "hack disaster" hackathon. 
Angel is a drone solutions company that provides complimentary software to optimize natural disaster management. I was responsible of the "Vulcan", and:
• Compared 13 ML models for wildfire forecasting on the cross-validation set using PyCaret.
• Chose the Extra Trees Classifier which scored 87.5% accuracy on the test set.
• Built another ML model to recognize fire in a video using InceptionV3 from the Keras API.
• Added several layers (dense, dropout and Global Average Pooling) for regularization which resulted in an accuracy of 97.5% on the test set.
